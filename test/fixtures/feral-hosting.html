<div class="ask">
    <div class="span-1 empty"></div>
    <div class="span-10">
        <h3>Are there any surcharges?</h3>
        <p><em>Absolutely none</em>! We don't handle your payments directly and only have access to the funds that you
            give us. This means we <em>have</em> to ask for everything up front and surprises can't happen.</p>
        <h3>How do I change my slot?</h3>
        <p>The slot summary page contains two links: to upgrade / change the slot and to initiate and complete
            slot-to-slot data transfers. Finally you may optionally request a refund on your existing slot via a support
            ticket.</p>
        <p>This can be done at any point during your month.</p>
        <h3>How do refunds work?</h3>
        <p>All slots can be cancelled in the first seven days for a full refund without fuss&#8213;just open a support
            ticket.</p>
        <p>Although we'd love feedback if something has gone wrong. Oh, and expect an eager support person to try and
            right that wrong.</p>
        <h3>Can I have a trial?</h3>
        <p>Want to test the water ahead of time? Not sure if a slot is right for you? Or perhaps you simply want to
            check things out without committing?</p>
        <p>You are more than welcome to request a refund in the first seven days to trial our slots. (It'll be a full
            refund too!)</p>
        <h3>How do I cancel?</h3>
        <p>You can cancel by simply not renewing. We will then recycle your slot shortly after its month is up and you
            will be welcome to return whenever you wish.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="span-2 empty"></div>
    <div class="span-10">
        <h3>Will you transfer data from a competitor?</h3>
        <p>Yes! Just open a support ticket once you've got a slot and we'll copy all data for you.</p>
        <h3>What happens if I exceed my storage quota?</h3>
        <p>We have quite a relaxed policy, you're free to go over your quota a little bit every once in a while. In
            return we ask that you look out for how your actions affect others and to play nice.</p>
        <p>We'll also provide you with the means to check your quota on demand and send you an e-mail if you're over. If
            this doesn't work out, we'll revert to strict limits.</p>
        <h3>Do you have any upload quotas?</h3>
        <p>We run our own ISP meaning upload quotas no longer makes sense for us. So we've removed them from all of our
            slots and promised to run an uncongested network 24 / 7.</p>
        <h3>I'm worried that you're overselling, are you?</h3>
        <p>We have pledged to never oversell our services. Our network is uncongested 24 / 7 and we own all of our own
            hardware so we're capable of making changes where necessary. We are happy to move users around to avoid
            bottlenecks.</p>
